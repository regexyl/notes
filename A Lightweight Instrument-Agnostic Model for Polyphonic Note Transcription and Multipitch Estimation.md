They highlighted methods that have been proposed to estimate notes from pitch posteriorgrams, e.g.
- median filtering
- [[Hidden Markov Model]]
- neural networks

Most approaches consider each semitone independently, but some approaches attempt to model interactions between notes, e.g.
- [[Spectral likelihood model]]
- [[Music language model]]

Transformers also have recently been used, directly predicting MIDI-like note events from spectograms in piano music.
