- There are different mediums to learn programming concepts:
	- video 
		- Pro: Being able to emulate the programmer teaching the tutorial even in areas not that werexplicitly intended to teach, which might be exceptionally helpful for novice learners. Things like - navigating a codebase with vim, 
		- Con: not being able to control your learning speed or easily skipping topics you don't necessarily need. Though it's improving with the ubiquity of audio-to-text tools coupled with AI - you could technically split videos into sections and read their summaries, or 'synopsis' if you will, and choose to skip ahead to certain section whenever you please. High quality audio-to-text transcriptions also lets you ctrl + f your way through the content, that's also timestamped along with the video, so you don't get lost as easily as before.
	- article - allows you to control your learning speed (which partially depends on your reading speed)
- There's a caveat: the learning journey of a concept isn't always linear, especially if code architecture is introduced.
