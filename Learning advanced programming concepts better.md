- This article is targeted towards the learning of programming concepts which analyzes existing code
- There are different mediums to learn programming concepts:
	- video 
		- Pros:
			- Being able to emulate the programmer teaching the tutorial even in areas not that were not explicitly intended to be taught, which might be exceptionally helpful for novice learners. Things like - navigating a codebase with vim, pushing to a remote repository via git, a more concise syntax trying to accomplish the same goal, etc. It's akin to "not knowing the unknown" - I had a phase where I was fanatically consuming information from the internet about different frontend tools and frameworks (throwing a slight shade at the blessing and the curse - that is major amount of tooling churn in the JS world here).
			- And then there's the obvious advantage that videos provide a myriad of visual stimulus most of the time, which might be more memorable compared to other mediums.
		- Cons:
			- not being able to control your learning speed or easily skipping topics you don't necessarily need. Though it's improving with the ubiquity of audio-to-text tools coupled with AI - you could technically split videos into sections and read their summaries, or 'synopsis' if you will, and choose to skip ahead to certain section whenever you please. High quality audio-to-text transcriptions also lets you ctrl + f your way through the content, that's also timestamped along with the video, so you don't get lost as easily as before.
	- article - allows you to control your learning speed (which partially depends on your reading speed)
- There's a caveat: the learning journey of a concept isn't always linear, especially if code architecture is introduced.
