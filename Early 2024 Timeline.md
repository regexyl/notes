Goals for rest of December
1. Finish AoC and AoT
2. Read Rust docs

Goals for Jan - Mar 2024
1. Contribute to rolldown
	1. Be proficient in Rust - 3 months
	2. Read rolldown codebase - 2 weeks
2. Start on the redesign of Chain Reaction + complete the multiplayer game - 1 month
3. Apply for jobs actively (3 applications/day) - 30 minutes
4. Practice DSA - 1.5-2 hours

If I try breaking down the above into a daily routine, it might look something like this:

Reaches
1. Apply for Georgia Tech masters
	1. Why would I want this? (1) For brand name recognition - might help with job application in the future. (2) To push me to learn more - tbh all the information that I need to learn would be online, but a structured timeline might be helpful in pushing me to do in-depth learning on a regular basis. (3) For networking.
	2. Why would I not want this? (1) Takes away time I could be using for other purposes. (2) Application requires 3(?) referrals, I could potentially ask Prof Jiang, Katia and Mike, but I need to think this through just in case I waste their time.
