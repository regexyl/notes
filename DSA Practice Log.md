- [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/) 🟠 (end: 9:42pm)
- [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/) 🟠 (end - kinda: 10:37pm) - Read a straightforward solution but I need to distill it further
	- #todo Revise [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/submissions/899091668/)
- Break (end 12:14am - had dinner and showered)
