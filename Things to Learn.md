Things to learn about in my downtime. I'm just putting things down here for times where I find myself twiddling my fingers and have nothing better to do.

- [ ] [R-trees]()[^r-tree-source]
- [ ] Why Rust does not play well with linked lists
	- [ ] Read [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/#learn-rust-with-entirely-too-many-linked-lists)
	- [ ] Read [Rust data structures with circular references](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2021/rust-data-structures-with-circular-references/ "Permalink to Rust data structures with circular references")

[^r-tree-source]: I was reading up different ways to solve Advent of Code 2023 Day 3's problem when I came across [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/189m3qw/comment/kc7riqn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that implemented an R-tree solution with C++. The question was asking for a way to count elements that were neighboring several types of prescribed punctuation values, in sort of a 2D matrix structure.
