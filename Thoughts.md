- Can I do anything about writing an article with [[How React Hot Loader came to be]]?
	- I've realized most of the 'magic' comes from Webpack, and exploring their codebase is no walk in the park.
	- It's going to take a load of time, and I'd do it in a heartbeat if there was a clear outcome of reading the codebase. Sure, one outcome is that I'd know a lot more about Webpack, but so what? So I can contribute to it? I'm not particular excited about the idea, when I can be doing something else like learning Rust and contributing to Rust frontend tooling instead.
