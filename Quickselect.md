Also known as [[Charles Hoare]]'s selection algorithm.

An algorithm typically used to solve problems like "find *k*th something", e.g. kth smallest, kth largest, kth most frequent, kth least frequent.

## How it works

It has the same approach as [[Quicksort]]

## Time complexity

- Average: `O(n)`
- Worse `O(n^2)`
