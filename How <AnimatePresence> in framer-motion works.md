Suppose you want to have a React component perform an animation before it exits. It's tricky, because there's no simple native way to do so. A component is either *in* the React tree or *not* and there's no in-between. It also does not have the knowledge of when exactly it gets removed from the tree prior to its removal.

An intuitive, non-Reacty way is to (1) start the exit animation, (2) wait till the animation is done, then (3) remove the element from the DOM. That's too much of a chore and not declarative enough for our tastes, so this is where external libraries are able to step in and create a workaround.

The two most popular choices now (circa Jan 2024) are [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/), started in [2016](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/commits?after=3341075c524bcf466241f5eafbc14bd407d24bc9+0), and [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion), started in [2018](https://github.com/framer/motion/commits?after=3105d6f745159c5f193510a221154797459c6732+0). I'm not too familiar with the former, so this article solely dives into the workings of `AnimatePresence` from Framer Motion and how it's able to enable exit animations.
