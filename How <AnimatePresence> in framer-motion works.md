Suppose you want to have a React component perform an animation before it exits. It's tricky, because there's no simple native way to do so. A component is either *in* the React tree or *not* and there's no in-between. It also does not have the knowledge of when exactly it gets removed from the tree prior to its removal.

An intuitive, non-Reacty way is to (1) start the exit animation, (2) wait till the animation is done, then (3) remove the element from the DOM. That's kind of a chore, isn't it? It's probably also not declarative[^declarative-vs-imperative] enough for our tastes, so perhaps this is where external libraries are able to step in and create a workaround.

The two most popular choices now (circa Jan 2024) are [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/), started in [2016](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/commits?after=3341075c524bcf466241f5eafbc14bd407d24bc9+0), and [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion), started in [2018](https://github.com/framer/motion/commits?after=3105d6f745159c5f193510a221154797459c6732+0). I'm not too familiar with the former, so this article solely dives into the workings of `AnimatePresence` from Framer Motion and how it's able to enable exit animations.

## A brief introduction to `AnimatePresence`

>`AnimatePresence`Â allows components to animate out when they're removed from the React tree. ([Framer Motion docs](https://www.framer.com/motion/animate-presence/))

This is what it looks like in code:

```tsx
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion"

export const MyComponent = ({ isVisible }) => (
  <AnimatePresence>
    {isVisible && (
      <motion.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      />
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>
)
```

We can see that `<motion.div>` is controlled by a conditional, `isVisible`, while `AnimatePresence` is an immediate wrapper component around its children with an exiting animation.

The exit animation is triggered when `isVisible` becomes `false`. Theoretically, `<motion.div>` should have been removed from the React tree - yet logically it doesn't make sense, since at the point of its "removal", `<motion.div>` is still performing its exit animation, so that means it still is somehow within the DOM!

Here's where `<AnimatePresence>` does something sneaky.

## The secret sauce: `React.useRef`

Did someone say "give me a tool that reliably stores existing state during re-renders *and* does not cause a component re-render when its state is updated"? `React.useRef` does just that. 

We also want to be able to control when exactly children within `AnimatePresence` re-render to minimize unnecessary overhead, so choosing `useRef` instead of `useState` comes in handy here.

With that in mind, here's how framer-motion implemented `AnimatePresence`:

Imagine there's reality and alternate reality. Picture React's version of the DOM tree as reality, and framer-motion's version as alternate reality. Because we want to enhance our React codebase with exiting animations, let's call this 'alternate reality' solely for the purpose of this explanation. 'Alternate reality' is what we want to show to users of our app, or whatever we're building, so that they see the fancy shmancy version of things instead of the dull, old vanilla version
