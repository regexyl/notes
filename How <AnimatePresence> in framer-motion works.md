Suppose you want to have a React component perform an animation before it exits. It's tricky, because there's no simple native way to do so.

An intuitive, non-Reacty way is to (1) start the exit animation, (2) wait till the animation is done, then (3) remove the element from the DOM. That's too much of a chore and not declarative enough for our tastes, so what about using external libraries for help?
