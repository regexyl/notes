Hi! I'm Regina. Welcome to my little nook on the internet!

I'm a software engineer from the sunny island of Singapore, but I'm also looking to relocate to London - it's my second home. I mainly work on the frontend with TypeScript, JavaScript and React, but I love to explore different technologies since the tools we use are simply means to an end.

I love making UIs faster, improving developer tooling and making the web accessible.
