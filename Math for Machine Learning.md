- Calculus
	- Basics: Derivatives, series and integrals
	- Needed for ML: Partial derivatives, vector calculus
	- Needed for Probability: Multiple integrals
	- Not that necessary: differential equations (unless you're specifically working on "physics informed neural networks" and comfortable with advanced physics and PDEs)
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics
	- E.g. regression
- Real Analysis (for theory of ML)
	- Convex analysis and optimization
